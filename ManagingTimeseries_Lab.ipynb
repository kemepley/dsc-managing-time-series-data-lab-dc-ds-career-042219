    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, you learned that time series data are everywhere and understanding time series data is an important skill for data scientists!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll practice your previously learned techniques to import/load, clean and manipulate time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab will cover how to perform time series analysis while working with large datasets. The dataset can be memory intensive so your computer will need at least 2GB of memory to perform some of the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load time series data using Pandas and perform time series indexing\n",
    "* Perform index based slicing to create subsets of a time series\n",
    "* Change the granularity of a time series \n",
    "* Perform basic data cleaning operations on time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start the lab by loading the required libraries \n",
    "\n",
    "* `pandas` for data wrangling and manipulations  \n",
    "* `matplotlib` for visualizing time series data \n",
    "* `statsmodels` primarily for bundled datasets "
